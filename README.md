# TELE 523 PBL Group 3  
## Design and Simulation of an Environmental Telemetry Monitoring System Using Urban Air Quality Data

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for a **Python-Based Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** project in **TELE 523**, focused on the **design and simulation of an end-to-end environmental telemetry monitoring system**.
The project uses **urban air quality data** to model a practical telemetry pipeline that starts from real sensor measurements and proceeds through:

- signal preprocessing,
- modulation,
- channel simulation,
- demodulation,
- digital telemetry processing,
- feature extraction,
- and monitoring output generation.

The engineering goal is to demonstrate how telemetry principles can be applied to a realistic environmental sensing problem using a modular and collaborative software architecture.

## Project Scope

The system is designed around an **environmental monitoring use case**, with emphasis on pollutant-related signals such as:

- PM
- NO2
- O3
- SO2
- drift behaviour
- threshold exceedance events

The project does **not** treat communication blocks as isolated theory. Instead, it models a complete telemetry chain where the output of one subsystem becomes the input of the next.

### Core objectives

- Prepare real environmental sensor data for telemetry analysis
- Simulate analog and digital telemetry stages
- Study signal behaviour under noise and transmission effects
- Convert signals into digital telemetry representations
- Detect events relevant to environmental monitoring
- Integrate all subsystems into one coherent pipeline
- Produce report-ready results, plots, and system documentation

## Technology Stack
The project is implemented in Python and uses a scientific computing workflow suitable for signal analysis and telemetry simulation.

Main language

- Python 3.10+

Core libraries

- numpy — numerical operations
- pandas — dataset handling and tabular processing
- matplotlib — plotting and report figures
- scipy — filtering, interpolation, and signal analysis
- openpyxl — Excel dataset handling
- streamlit — dashboard and monitoring interface
- pytest — testing and validation

Development environment(s)

- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- Git and GitHub for version control

---
## Data Workflow

The repository follows a structured data progression:
1. Raw data is stored unchanged in data/raw/
2. Interim data contains cleaned or reshaped outputs
3. Processed data contains finalized files for downstream subsystem use

This separation is important because it:
- preserves the original data,
- makes preprocessing traceable,
- reduces confusion between intermediate and final outputs,
- and improves reproducibility.
